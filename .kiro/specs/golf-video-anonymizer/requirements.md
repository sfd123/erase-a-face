# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Golf Video Anonymizer is a service that automatically detects and blurs faces in golf swing videos to protect the privacy and anonymity of players while preserving the technical aspects of their swing for analysis, coaching, or sharing purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a golf instructor, I want to upload a video of a student's golf swing and receive back a version with the face blurred, so that I can share swing analysis publicly without compromising the student's privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a video file THEN the system SHALL accept common video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI)
2. WHEN the system processes the video THEN it SHALL detect human faces in each frame
3. WHEN a face is detected THEN the system SHALL apply a blur effect to obscure facial features
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a downloadable anonymized video file
5. WHEN no faces are detected THEN the system SHALL return the original video unchanged

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a golfer, I want the face blurring to be consistent throughout the video, so that my identity remains protected even as I move during the swing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a face moves between frames THEN the system SHALL track the face position and maintain blur coverage
2. WHEN the face changes size due to camera distance THEN the system SHALL adjust the blur area accordingly
3. WHEN the face rotates or changes angle THEN the system SHALL maintain blur coverage across different facial orientations
4. WHEN multiple people appear in the video THEN the system SHALL blur all detected faces

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the video quality to remain high after processing, so that the golf swing technique is still clearly visible for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing the video THEN the system SHALL preserve the original video resolution
2. WHEN applying blur effects THEN the system SHALL maintain video frame rate
3. WHEN encoding the output THEN the system SHALL use quality settings that preserve swing detail visibility
4. WHEN the blur is applied THEN it SHALL only affect the facial area and not interfere with club or ball visibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive feedback on processing status, so that I know when my video is ready and if any issues occurred.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and size
2. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL provide status updates on progress
3. WHEN processing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide download access
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages explaining the issue
5. WHEN no faces are detected THEN the system SHALL inform the user that no anonymization was needed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a service administrator, I want the system to handle various video conditions, so that it works reliably across different recording scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN videos have different lighting conditions THEN the system SHALL detect faces in both bright and dim lighting
2. WHEN videos are recorded from different angles THEN the system SHALL detect faces from profile and frontal views
3. WHEN videos contain motion blur THEN the system SHALL attempt face detection on clearer frames
4. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL handle videos up to reasonable size limits (e.g., 500MB)
5. WHEN multiple processing requests occur THEN the system SHALL queue and process them efficiently
